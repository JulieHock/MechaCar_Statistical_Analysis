## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

-Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The variables that best predict mpg values in the dataset are vehicle length and ground clearance.  With a p-value if 2.60e-12 for vehicle length, which is less than alpha level of 0.05, we reject the null.  There is evidence to suggest there is some relationship between mpg and vehicle length.  With a p-value of 5.21e-08 for ground clearance, which is less than alpha level of 0.05, we reject the null.  There is evidence to suggest there is some relationship between mpg and ground clearance.

-Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?



Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
